=======================

Strongy Typed is a responsive HTML5 template by HTML5UP.  This repo ports it to the Jekyll site generator.

Getting started: 

Clone this repo and then either use it as a project page with the site code in gh-pages branch, or copy the site code to the master branch if you're using it as a user or organization page.

See the [Github pages](http://pages.github.com) documentation and the great [docs on Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) itself to learn more about the system.

To run locally in development mode, run the command 

 jekyll serve --watch --baseurl ''

 and if you are forking, you'll need to set `baseurl` in \_config.yml as described here: http://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/.
